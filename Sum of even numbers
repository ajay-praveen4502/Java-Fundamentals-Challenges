Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to ‘n’ , the size of the array. The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer sample output for details.

Sample Input :

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output 1:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //creating an object for scanner class
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int size = sc.nextInt();
        int [] arr = new int [size];
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< size ;i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i< size ;i++){
            if (arr[i] % 2 == 0){
                sum += arr[i];
            }
            else{
                continue;
            }
        }
        System.out.print("The sum of the even numbers in the array is "+sum);
        
    }
}
