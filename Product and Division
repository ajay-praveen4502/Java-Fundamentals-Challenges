Write a program to get 2 numbers from the user and calculate their product, quotient and remainder using '*', '/' and '%' operators respectively.

Print the corresponding product, quotient and remainder of the numbers as output in the console.

Input format:

First input: an integer

Second input: an integer

Output format:

The first output will be the product of two integers

The second output will be the quotient

The third output will be the remainder

Sample Input:
50

10

Sample Output:

500

5

0

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main

    public static void main(String args[])

        // creating an object for the Scanner function
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);          
        
        //declaring 2 variables for user input
        int a,b;
        
        //getting user input for the 2 variables
        a = sc.nextInt();
        b = sc.nextInt();
        
        //Printing the result of the product, quotient and remainder
        System.out.println(a*b);
        System.out.println(a/b);
        System.out.println(a%b);
    }
