    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        // initializing the length and breadth of the field into variables
        int length, breadth, perimeter, area;
        
        //creating an object for the Scanner function
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //getting the user inputs for the variables
        length = sc.nextInt();
        breadth = sc.nextInt();
        
        //calculation of perimeter and area
        perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);
        System.out.println("Required length is "+perimeter+"m");
        
        area = length * breadth;
        System.out.print("Required quantity of carpet is "+area+"sqm");
    }
