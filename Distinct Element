Write a program to find the number of distinct elements in a sorted array.

Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array. The next n integers correspond to the elements in the array. Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Output consists of a single integer which corresponds to the number of distinct elements in the array.

Sample Input:

5

3

3

3

78

90

Sample Output:

3

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //create an object for the scanner class
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //initialize the variables for user input
        int size = sc.nextInt();
        int [] arr = new int [size];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i< size; i++){
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i< size ;i++){
            if ( i == 0 || arr[i] != arr[i-1]){
                count+=1;
            }
        }
        System.out.print(count);
    }
}
