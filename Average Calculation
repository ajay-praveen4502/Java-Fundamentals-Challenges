A teacher wants to compute the average of 5 students in her class. Write a program to help her to find the average.
The average is the sum of all the numbers, then divided by the total numbers.

Input format:

First input: 1st student mark in float

Second input: 2nd student mark in float

Third input: 3rd student mark in float

Fourth input:4th student mark in float

Fifth input: 5th student mark in float

Output format:

The output value should be in float with 2 decimal places.

Sample Input:

10 

20

30

40

50

Sample Output:

30.00

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        //Creating an object for the Scanner function
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //creating 5 variables for the 5 students scores and a sum and avg variable
        float first_Student,second_Student,third_Student,fourth_Student,fifth_Student,sum;
        float avg;
        //getting the user input for the student marks
        first_Student = sc.nextFloat();
        second_Student = sc.nextFloat();
        third_Student = sc.nextFloat();
        fourth_Student = sc.nextFloat();
        fifth_Student = sc.nextFloat();
        
        //calculating the average
        sum = first_Student + second_Student + third_Student + fourth_Student +fifth_Student;
        avg = sum / 5;
        
        System.out.print(avg);
        
    }
}
