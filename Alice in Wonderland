She found a cute bird, standing in one of the tree. Alice asked the bird the way to go back to her home.The bird said a two digit number( say 23 ) and asked her to find the sum of its digits (2+3=5) and that numbered way will lead her to her home.Alice was already confused, so pls help Alice in finding the route to her home....
