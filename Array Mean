Write a program to find the mean of the elements in the array.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array. It is printed upto 2 digits of precision.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

 

Sample Input and Output :

 

Enter the number of elements in the array

5

Enter the elements in the array

2

4

1

3

5

The mean of the array is 3.00


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //Creation of object for Scanner class
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //initializing the vairables for user input
        System.out.println("Enter the number of elements in the array");
        int size = sc.nextInt();                //5
        double mean;                            //initializing double for mean variable
        int sum = 0;                
        int [] arr = new int [size];            //creating new array
        System.out.println("Enter the elements in the array");
        for (int i =0 ; i< size ; i++){         // 0 1 2 3 4
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();              //inserting new values in the array
        }
        for (int i = 0; i<size ;i++){
            sum += arr[i];                      //getting the sum of all values
            
        }
        mean = sum / size;                      //calculating the mean values
        System.out.printf("The mean of the array is %.2f", mean);
    }
}
